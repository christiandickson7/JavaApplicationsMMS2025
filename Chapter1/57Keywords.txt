The 57 Java Keywords We Have
Abstract: Declares a close or method that cannot be instantiated directly / has no body (must be overridden)
Assert: Used for debugging - checks if a condition is true; throws Assertion Error if false
Boolean: Primitive type that can only hold true or false 
Break: Exists the nearest loop (for, while, do) or switch block 
Byte: Primitive type – 8- bit integer (-128 to 127)
Case: Label in switch statement for a specific value 
Catch: Catches and handles an exception thrown in a try block 
Char: Primitive type – single 16-bit Unicode character 
Class: Declares a class (blueprint for objects) 
Const: Reserved (unused in Java – was planned but never implemented) 
Continue: Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and goes to the next one
Default: 1) Default label in switch 
         2) Default method in interface (since Java 8) 
Do: Starts a do-while loop (executes at least once) 
Double: Primitive type – 64-bit floating-point number with decimal points 
Else: Executes code when the if condition is false 
Enum: Declares an enumerated type (fixed set of constants) 
Extends: 1) Class inherits from another class 2) Interface inherits from another interface
Final: 1) Variable –constant
	   2) Method –cannot be overridden
	   3) Class –cannot be extended
Finally: Block that always executes after try-catch (clean-up code)
Float: Primitive type - 32-bit floating-point number with decimal points
For:  Creates a for-loop (usually with counter)
Goto: Reserved (unused in Java – considered harmful)
If: Executes code only if a condition is true
Implements: Class promises to provide all methods of an interface
Import: Brings classes from other packages into current file
Instance of: Checks if an objects is an instance of a class/interface
Int: Primitive type – 32-bit integer
Interface: Declares a contract (methods a class must implement)
Long: Primitive type – 64-bit integer
Native: method is implemented in another language (usually C/C++)
New: Creates a new object/ array 
Package: Groups related classes (like a folder/namespace)
Private: Member accessible only within the same class
Protected: Member accessible within same package + subclasses (even in other packages)
Public: Member accessible from everywhere 
Return: Exists a method and optionally returns a value 
Short: Primitive type- 16-bit integer
Static: Member belongs to the class (not to objects) – shared by all instances
Strictfp: Ensures floating-point calculations are consistent across platforms (rarely used)
Super: 1) Calls superclass constructor/method
	   2) Refers to superclass member 
Switch: Selects one of many code blocks based on a value (expression)
Synchronized: Ensures only one thread can access a block/method at a time (thread safety)
This: Refers to the current object instance
Throw: Manually throws an exception
Throws: Declares that a method can throw certain checked exceptions
Transient: Field should not be serialized (saved) when object is serialized
Try: Starts a block where exceptions might occur 
Void: Method returns no value 
Volatile: Variable may change unexpectedly (prevents compiler/CPU from reordering/optimizing access)
While: Repeats a block of code while a condition is true
Var: Local variable type inference (compiler guesses the type) – Java 10+ 
Record: Declares a simple immutable data class (auto-generates constructor, getters, equals, etc.) – Java 16+
Sealed: Restricts which classes/interfaces can extend/ implement this type – Java 17+
Non_sealed: Allows a subclass of a sealed class to be extended further – Java 17+
Permits: Lists the only classes allowed to extend/implement a sealed type - Java 17+ 
Yield: Returns a value from a switch expression (not a statement) – Java 14
