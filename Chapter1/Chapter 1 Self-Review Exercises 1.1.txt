Discuss how each of the following terms and concepts applies to the notion of a watch: object, attributes, behaviors, class, inheritance (consider, for example, an alarm clock), modeling, messages, encapsulation, interface and information hiding. Making a Difference 1.9 (Test-Drive: Carbon Footprint Calculator) Some scientists believe that carbon emissions, especially from the burning of fossil fuels, contribute significantly to global warming and that this can be combatted if individuals take steps to limit their use of carbon-based fuels. Organizations and individuals are increasingly concerned about their “carbon footprints.” Websites such as TerraPass http://www.terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator/ and Carbon Footprint http://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx provide carbon-footprint calculators. Test-drive these calculators to determine your carbon footprint. Exercises in later chapters will ask you to program your own carbon-footprint calculator. To prepare for this, use the web to research the formulas for calculating carbon footprints. 1.10 (Test-Drive: Body Mass Index Calculator) Obesity causes significant increases in illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. To determine whether a person is overweight or obese, you can use a measure called the body mass index (BMI). The United States Department of Health and Human Services provides a BMI calculator at http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/BMI/ bmicalc.htm. Use it to calculate your own BMI. A forthcoming exercise will ask you to program your own BMI calculator. To prepare for this, use the web to research the formulas for calculating BMI. 1.11 (Attributes of Hybrid Vehicles) Hybrid vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, because they often get much better mileage than purely gasoline-powered vehicles. Browse the web and study the features of four or five of today’s popular hybrid cars, then list as many of their hybrid-related attributes as you can. Some common attributes include city-miles-per-gallon and highway-miles-per-gallon. Also list the attributes of the batteries (type, weight, etc.). 1.12 (Gender Neutrality) Many people want to eliminate sexism in all forms of communication. You’ve been asked to create a program that can process a paragraph of text and replace gender-specific words with gender-neutral ones. Assuming that you’ve been given a list of gender-specific words and their gender-neutral replacements (e.g., replace both “wife” and “husband” with “spouse,” “man” and “woman” with “person,” “daughter” and “son” with “child”), explain the procedure you’d use to read through a paragraph of text and manually perform these replacements. How might your procedure generate a strange term like “woperchild?” You’ll soon learn that a more formal term for “procedure” is “algorithm,” and that an algorithm specifies the steps to be performed and the order in which to perform them. We’ll show how to develop algorithms then convert them to Java programs which can be run on computers.
